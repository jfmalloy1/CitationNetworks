DB00193,APRD00028,small molecule,2005-06-13,2020-01-02,Tramadol,"Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization's pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of [morphine]. 

Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a μ-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.[A182279] Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as [duloxetine] and [venlafaxine].

Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842] 

Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.[A183728,A183734,A183761,A17159,A182300] Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain.[A182300]

Similar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse. If used in higher doses, or with other opioids, there is a dose-related risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death.[A183830,F4679] However, unlike other opioid medications, tramadol use also carries a risk of seizure and serotonin syndrome, particularly if used with other serotonergic medications.[A183836,A179926]",27203-92-5,0NG5TTM63P,263.3752,263.188529049,solid,2,26,0,2,"Wolfgang Reimann, ""Combination preparation containing tramadol and a calcium channel antagonist."" U.S. Patent US5929122, issued March, 1993.","Tramadol is approved for the management of moderate to severe pain in adults.[F4676,F4679]

Tramadol is also used off-label in the treatment of premature ejaculation.[A173986]","Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.[A173983,A173980] 

Apart from analgesia, tramadol may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids. 

**Central Nervous System**

In contrast to [morphine], tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.[F4676]

Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centres. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem centres to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. 

Tramadol depresses the cough reflex by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia.

Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but
are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce
similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of
oxycodone overdose.[F4679]

Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures
or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders,
alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections), or with concomitant use of other drugs known to reduce the seizure threshold.[F4679]

Tramadol can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs (e.g., anti-depressants, migraine medications). Treatment with the serotoninergic drug should be discontinued if such events (characterized by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Tramadol should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan, oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in combination with other serotonergic drugs (triptans, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, St. John’s Wort) due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.[F4679]

**Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle**

Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.[F4679]

**Endocrine System**

Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.[F4679]

Hyponatremia has been reported very rarely with the use of tramadol, usually in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as elderly patients and/or patients using concomitant medications that may cause hyponatremia (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, diuretics). In some reports, hyponatremia appeared to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and resolved with discontinuation of tramadol and appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction). During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors.[F4679]

**Cardiovascular**

Tramadol administration may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain adequate blood pressure is compromised by reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines and other tranquillizers, sedative/hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or general anesthetics. These patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of tramadol.[F4679]

**QTc-Interval Prolongation**

The maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcF interval was 5.5 ms in the 400 mg/day treatment arm and 6.5 ms in the 600 mg/day mg treatment arm, both occurring at the 8h time point. Both treatment groups were within the 10 ms threshold for QT prolongation. Post-marketing experience with the use of tramadol containing products included rare reports of QT prolongation reported with an overdose. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.[F4679]

**Abuse and Misuse**

Like all opioids, tramadol has the potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.[F4679]

**Dependence/Tolerance**

Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse. Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4679]","Tramadol is a centrally acting μ-opioid receptor agonist and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Tramadol binds weakly to κ- and δ-opioid receptors and to the μ-opioid receptor with 6000-fold less affinity than morphine.[A182300]

Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269] 

In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in μ-opioid binding.[F4676,F4670] 

Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of pain modulators including alpha2-adrenoreceptors, neurokinin 1 receptors, the voltage-gated sodium channel type II alpha subunit[A183728], transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1 - also known as the capsaicin receptor)[A183734], muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or glutamate receptor)[A17158], Adenosine A1 receptors[A183761], and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.[A17159] 

In addition to the above neuronal targets, tramadol has a number of effects on inflammatory and immune mediators involved in the pain response. This includes inhibitory effects on cytokines, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nuclear factor-κB, and glial cells as well as a change in the polarization state of M1 macrophages.[A182300]","Tramadol undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver by N- and O- demethylation and conjugation. From the extensive metabolism, there have been identified at least 23 metabolites. There are two main metabolic pathways: the O-demethylation of tramadol to produce O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) catalyzed by CYP2D6 and the N-demethylation to N-desmethyl-tramadol (M2) catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6.[A4269,F4676,F4679]

The wide variability in the pharmacokinetic properties between patients can partly be ascribed to polymorphisms within the gene for CYP2D6 that determine its enzymatic activity. CYP2D6\*1 is considered the wild-type allele associated with normal enzyme activity and the ""extensive metabolizer"" phenotype; 90-95% of Caucasians are considered ""extensive metabolizers"" (with normal CYP2D6 function) while the remaining 5-10% are considered ""poor metabolizers"" with reduced or non-functioning enzyme.[A182294] CYP2D6 alleles associated with non-functioning enzyme include *3, *4, *5, and *6 while alleles associated with reduced activity include *9, *10, *17, and *41.[A183812]

Poor metabolizers have reduced activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme and therefore less production of tramadol metabolites M1 and M2, which ultimately results in a reduced analgesic effect as tramadol interacts with the μ-opioid receptor primarily via M1.[A4269] 

There are also large differences in the frequency of these alleles between different ethnicities: \*3, \*4, \*5, \*6, and \*41 are more common among Caucasians while \*17 is more common in Africans for example.[A183812] Compared to 5-10% of Caucasians, only ~1% of Asians are considered poor metabolizers, however Asian populations carry a much higher frequency (51%) of the CYP2D6\*10 allele, which is relatively rare in Caucasian populations and results in higher exposure to tramadol.[A182294]

Some individuals are considered ""ultra-rapid metabolizers"", such as those carrying CYP2D6 gene duplications (CYP2D6*DUP) or multiplications. These individuals are at risk of intoxication or exaggerated effects of tramadol due to higher concentrations of its active metabolite (M1).[A182297] The occurrence of this phenotype is seen in approximately 1% to 2% of East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), 1% to 10% of Caucasians, 3% to 4% of African-Americans, and may be >10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (ie, Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). The FDA label recommends avoiding the use of tramadol in these individuals.[F4676,F4679]","**Oral Administration**

Tramadol is administered as a racemate, with both the [-] and [+] forms of both tramadol and the M1 metabolite detected in circulation. Following administration, racemic tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, with a bioavailability of 75%. This difference in absorption and bioavailability can be attributed to the 20-30% first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma concentrations of tramadol and the primary metabolite M1 occur at two and three hours, respectively.[F4679] Following a single oral dose of 100mg of tramadol, the Cmax was found to be approximately 300μg/L with a Tmax of 1.6-1.9 hours, while metabolite M1 was found to have a Cmax of 55μg/L with a Tmax of 3 hours.[A4269,F4676] 

Steady-state plasma concentrations of both tramadol and M1 are achieved within two days of dosing. There is no evidence of self-induction.[F4679] Following multiple oral doses, Cmax is 16% higher and AUC is 36% higher than after a single dose, demonstrating a potential role of saturable first-pass hepatic metabolism in increasing bioavailability.[A4269]

**Intramuscular Administration**

Tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following intramuscular administration. Following injection of 50mg of tramadol, Cmax of 166μg/L was found with a Tmax of 0.75 hours.[A4269]

**Rectal Administration**

Following rectal administration with suppositories containing 100mg of tramadol, Cmax of 294μg/L  was found with a Tmax of 3.3 hours. The absolute bioavailability was found to be higher than oral administration (77% vs 75%), likely due to reduced first-pass metabolism with rectal administration compared to oral administration.[A4269]",Tramadol reported a half-life of 5-6 hours while the M1 metabolite presents a half-life of 8 hours.[A173980],About 20% of the administered dose is found to bind to plasma proteins. Protein binding appears to be independent of concentrations up to 10μg/mL. Saturation only occurs at concentrations outside of the clinical range.[F4679],"Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are excreted primarily by the kidneys, accounting for 90% of the excretion while the remaining 10% is excreted through feces.[F4676,F4679,A173980] Approximately 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites.[A174010]

The mean terminal plasma elimination half-lives of racemic tramadol and racemic M1 are 6.3 ± 1.4 and 7.4 ± 1.4 hours, respectively. The plasma elimination half-life of racemic tramadol increased from approximately six hours to seven hours upon multiple dosing.[F4676,F4679]","The volume of distribution of tramadol is reported to be in the range of 2.6-2.9 L/kg.[F4676,F4679] Tramadol has high tissue affinity; the total volume of distribution after oral administration was 306L and 203L after parenteral administration.[A182300] Tramadol crosses the blood-brain barrier with peak brain concentrations occurring 10 minutes following oral administration. It also crosses the placental barrier with umbilical concentrations being found to be ~80% of maternal concentrations.[A4269]","In clinical trials, the clearance rate of tramadol ranged from 3.73 ml/min/kg in renal impairment patients to 8.50 ml/min/kg in healthy adults.[F4676,F4679]",RybixShionogi Inc.TramalGrünenthal GmbH,0,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00193.pdf?1265922808,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00193.pdf?1265922745,1,1983,"The reported LD50 for tramadol, when administered orally in mice, is 350 mg/kg.[A174010] 

In carcinogenic studies, there are reports of murine tumors which cannot be concluded to be carcinogenic in humans. On the other hand, tramadol showed no evidence to be mutagenic in different assays and does not have effects on fertility. However, there are clear reports of embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity.[F4676,F4679]"
DB00295,"APRD00215,DB05354",small molecule,2005-06-13,2020-01-02,Morphine,"Morphine is the main alkaloid of opium and it was first obtained from the poppy seeds in 1805.[A176035] It is the most potent analgesic for chronic pain but its use is limited due to the induction of tolerance, severe withdrawal symptoms and high risk of relapse and abuse.[A176050] In its pure form, morphine is ten times more potent than opium and due to this property, it was used extensively in the US Civil War which resulted in approximately 400,000 addicted soldiers. After this event, around the second half of the nineteenth-century, the science made several efforts to find a less addictive alternative which brought the synthesis of [heroin]. However, morphine is still the precursor to other opioids such as [codeine], [fentanyl], [methadone], [hydrocodone], [hydromorphone], [meperidine], and [oxycodone].[L5716] Morphine's first official product was developed by West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Int. and FDA approved in 1984.[L5713]",57-27-2,76I7G6D29C,285.3377,285.136493479,solid,2,9,0,3,,"Morphine is used for the management of chronic moderate-to-severe pain.[A176050]

Opioids, including morphine, can manage pain effectively when used for a short amount of time. The use of opioids for longer periods needs to be monitored as they can develop a physical dependence, addiction disorder and drug abuse.[L5728]","The binding of morphine in the opioid receptors blocks the transmission of nociceptive signals, it activates the signaling of pain-modulating neurons in the spinal cord and inhibits the transmission from primary afferent nociceptors to the dorsal horn sensory projection cells.[A176035]

The onset of action is of 6-30 minutes.[A176035] The excess in the consumption of morphine and opioids, in general, can produce changes in the synaptic neuroplasticity mainly in the postsynaptic sites, dendritic terminals and modifications in the density.[A176056]

Analysis of intravenous morphine showed that the attenuation of pain and analgesic effect was sex-dependent. The potency of the morphine effect is of around half in men when compared to the effect in women, as observed with an EC50 of 76 and 33 ng/ml respectively. As well, the effect of the active metabolite of morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide, was only about 22 times less potent than the morphine when analyzed in pupil constriction.[A176116]","It is important to consider that about 85% of the effect observed by morphine administration is due to the activity of morphine-6-glucuronide.[A176059] Morphine and its metabolites act as agonists of the mu and the kappa opioid receptors which derive later into analgesia.[A176035] The mu-opioid receptor is a key part of the effect of morphine in the ventral tegmental area which reinforces the effects of morphine. However, in studies with delta opioid receptor knock-out mice, it was reported a reduction in the rewarding effect of morphine suggesting that the rewarding effect of morphine is related to activity towards the delta opioid receptor in the nucleus accumbens.[A176050]

From the three target receptors of morphine, the mu receptor is associated with the side effects of the morphine such as modifications in the respiratory system and addiction.[A176056]","Around 90% of morphine is glucuronidated and sulfated in position 3 and 6 by the activity of UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase-2B7 in the liver.[A176059] The glucuronide metabolites do not reach steady-state before 60 hours. From these metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide presents lower clearance, a smaller volume of distribution and shorter half-life when compared to the most active biologically metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide.[A176035] Other than this major metabolites, some other metabolites are codeine, normorphine, and morphine ethereal sulfate.[A176119]","Morphine presents an almost complete absorption mainly done in an alkaline environment in the upper intestine as well as in the rectal mucosa.[A176119] Morphine presents significant first-pass metabolism and thus, oral doses are required to be six times bigger than parenteral administration in order to achieve the same analgesic effect. The steady-state concentration of morphine is achieved after 24-48 hours of initial administration,[A176035] and a peak plasma concentration of 283 nmol/L can range from 15 min when administered parentally to 90 min when administered orally.[A176122, A176164] The AUC of morphine is reported to be in the range of 225-290 nmol.h/L with a bioavailability that can range from 80-100% depending on the route of administration.[A176164]",Morphine has an equilibrated half-life of 2-3 hours.[A176116],"Morphine presents a low protein binding of around 35%. On the other hand, the metabolites morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide present an even lower bound state representing 10% and 15% of the circulating dose respectively.[A176059]","The elimination of morphine and its metabolites is mainly done by the urine from which only 2-10% of the dose corresponds to the unchanged form.[A176059] However, right after oral administration, there is extensive presystemic elimination through passage across the bowel wall and through the liver. From the elimination route, about 70-80% of the administered dose is excreted after 48 hours.[A176119]",Morphine presents a significantly low transfer between plasma and the effect site.[A176116] The reported volume of distribution of morphine is 5.31 L/kg while for morphine-6-glucuronide is of 3.61 L/kg.[A176119],The apparent clearance of morphine administered intravenously and subcutaneously is 1600 ml/min.[A176164],KapanolMayne Pharma/GlaxoMSIRPurdue PharmaOramorphBoeringher Ingelheim,1,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00295.pdf?1553549796,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00295.pdf?1553287178,3,1498,"Based on cases of morphine intoxication, the LD50 is reported to be of 0.78 mcg/ml in males and 0.98 mcg/ml in females.[A176167] The cases of overdose are presented mainly as respiratory depression, extreme somnolence, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, miosis and mydriasis. These symptoms can lead to pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension cardiac arrest and death.[FDA label]

In cases of overdose, it is key to re-establish the patient airway and consider using oxygen and vasopressors to manage the circulatory shock and pulmonary edema. Consider the use of naloxone as an antidote and avoid the use of morphine antagonists if there aren't clear signs of respiratory depression and monitor the signs of withdrawal when used.[FDA label]

Morphine was shown to increase the DNA fragmentation, to be mutagenic in micronucleus, and to induce chromosomal aberration. All these effects are thought to be related to the morphine-induced increase in glucocorticoid levels. Related to the effects on fertility, morphine is shown to reduce the number of total pregnancies, increase in the incidence of pseudopregnancies, reduction in the number of implantation sites and changes in the hormonal profile. On the other hand, carcinogenic studies haven't been done so far.[FDA label]"
DB00318,"APRD00120,DB09471",small molecule,2005-06-13,2020-01-02,Codeine,"The relief of pain (analgesia) is a primary goal for enhancing the quality of life of patients and for increasing the ability of patients to engage in day to day activities. Codeine, an opioid analgesic, was originally approved in the US in 1950 and is a drug used to decrease pain by increasing the threshold for pain without impairing consciousness or altering other sensory functions. Opiates such as codeine are derived from the poppy plant, _Papaver somniferum_ (Papaveraceae).[A175096]

Codeine is utilized as a central analgesic, sedative, hypnotic, antinociceptive, and antiperistaltic agent, and is also recommended in certain diseases with incessant coughing.[LABEL,A175096]",76-57-3,UX6OWY2V7J,299.3642,299.152143543,solid,2,9,0,3,"Nagaraj R.

It is available in tablet form [FDA label] and indicated for the relief of mild to moderately severe pain, where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate [FDA label].

The solution form is used by itself or combined in a syrup with other drugs and is used as a cough suppressant in adults aged 18 and above [L5521], [L5524]. ","
**General effects**

Codeine is a weak narcotic pain reliever and cough suppressant that is similar to morphine and hydrocodone. A small amount of ingested codeine is converted to morphine in the body. Codeine increases tolerance to pain, reducing existing discomfort. In addition to decreasing pain, codeine also causes sedation, drowsiness, and respiratory depression [A175096]. 


**Antitussive activity**

This drug has shown antitussive activity in clinical trials [A175102] and has been effective in cough secondary to tuberculosis and insomnia due to coughing [A175096]. Codeine suppresses the cough reflex through a direct effect on the cough center in the medulla [F3658].

**Effects on intestinal motility**

Codeine may reduce intestinal motility through both a local and possibly central mechanism of action [F3661]. This may possibly lead to constipation [F3658]. The chronic use of opioids, including codeine sulfate, may lead to obstructive bowel disease, particularly in patients with underlying disorders of intestinal motility [FDA label]. 

**Effects on the central nervous system**

Codeine phosphate is an opioid analgesic with uses similar to those of morphine, but is much less potent as an analgesic. Its primary site of action is at the _mu_ opioid receptors distributed throughout the central nervous system. The sedative activities of codeine are less potent than those of morphine [F3658]. Codeine may cause respiratory system depression by the activation of μ-opioid receptors at specific sites in the central nervous system [A175108].

**Effects on blood pressure**

This drug poses an increased risk of compromised ability to maintain blood pressure due to peripheral vasodilation and other mechanisms [FDA label]. 


**Effects on chronic cancer pain and other types of pain**

Codeine is an opioid analgesic with similar indications to those of morphine, however, is much less potent in its pain alleviating properties. Its primary action takes place at the mu opioid receptors, which are distributed throughout the central nervous system. The average duration of action is about 4 hours [F3658].

Regular dosing of opioid analgesics such as codeine in patients with severe cancer pain has been well documented to improve symptoms [A175096], [A175105].","Codeine is a selective agonist for the mu opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity to this receptor than morphine, a more potent opioid drug. Codeine binds to mu-opioid receptors, which are involved in the transmission of pain throughout the body and central nervous system [FDA label], [A175096]. The analgesic properties of codeine are thought to arise from its conversion to [Morphine], although the exact mechanism of analgesic action is unknown at this time [FDA label], [F3658].","Approximately 70 to 80% of the ingested dose of codeine is metabolized in the liver by conjugation with glucuronic acid to _codeine-6­ glucuronide_ (C6G) and by O-demethylation to _morphine_ (about 5-10%) and N-demethylation to _norcodeine_ (about 10%) respectively. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B4 are the major metabolic enzymes mediating the glucurodination of codeine to the metabolite, _codeine 6 glucuronide_. 

Cytochrome P450 2D6 is the major enzyme responsible for the transformation of codeine to morphine and P450 3A4 is the main enzyme mediating the conversion of codeine to _norcodeine_. Morphine and norcodeine are then further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. The glucuronide metabolites of morphine are _morphine-3-glucuronide_ (M3G) and_ morphine-6-glucuronide _(M6G). Morphine and M6G have been proven to have analgesic activity in humans. The analgesic activity of C6G in humans is not known at this time. Norcodeine and M3G are generally not considered to have analgesic properties [FDA label]. ","**Absorption**

DB00327,APRD01021,small molecule,2005-06-13,2020-01-02,Hydromorphone,"Hydromorphone is a pure opioid,[A176468] a semi-synthetic hydrogenated ketone derivative of [morphine] that has been available clinically since 1920. Structurally, hydromorphone derived from [morphine] in the modification of the hydroxyl group in the carbon 6 to a carbonyl and the absence of a double bond between the carbon 7 and 8. Due to these modifications, it presents a very high potency and comparable side effect profile to the parent compound.[A176471] Even though hydromorphone does not present a 6-hydroxyl group, it is categorized under the family of phenanthrenes and it is considered a chemical under the schedule II (medical purposes with high addiction potential).[A176495]

The first reported approved product containing hydromorphone in the form of hydromorphone hydrochloride was developed by Fresenius Kabi USA and FDA approved in 1984.[L5795]",466-99-9,Q812464R06,285.3377,285.136493479,solid,2,8,0,2,,"Hydromorphone is indicated for the management of moderate to severe acute pain and severe chronic pain. Due to its addictive potential and overdose risk, hydromorphone is only prescribed when other first-line treatments have failed.[A176468]

The WHO has proposed a three-step ladder for the management of pain in which it is suggested to start with a non-opioid medication followed by addition of weak opioids to the non-opioid treatment for moderate pain and finishing in the use of strong opioids such as hydromorphone along with the existing regimen for cases of severe pain.[A176471]

Off-label, hydromorphone can be administered for the suppression of refractory cough.[A176468]","In clinical trials, hydromorphone has been shown to be suitable for pain relief in patients that do not tolerate the side effects of [morphine] or that suffer from renal failure or asthma. It has been shown to be 5-7 times more potent than morphine with a shorter duration of analgesia.[A176471]

Some of the observed effects of the consumption of hydromorphone for acute pain are complete and longlasting pain relief when compared to other pain relief agents such as [meperidine], [morphine], [diamorphine], [bupivacaine], [indomethacin], and [fentanyl]. On the same trials, hydromorphone was shown to produce respiratory depression, lower cognitive function, miosis, mydriasis, constipation, hypotension, and vertigo but to present a reduced incidence of pruritus (which indicates a lower release of histamine) and nausea.[A176507]

The respiratory depression is known to be caused by the effect on the brain stem respiratory centers as well as to a reduction in the responsiveness of this brain stems to increase carbon dioxide tension.[L5798]","Hydromorphone is an opioid agonist that can bind to different types of opioid receptors. Its analgesic effect is suggested to be related to the effect on the mu-opioid receptors. It has been reported to also have a minor affinity for the delta and kappa receptor.[A176495, A176504] On the other hand, it is known to act at the level of the medulla which allows it to depress the respiratory drive and suppress cough.[A176468]

The onset of action of the immediate release form of hydromorphone is achieved in 15-20 minutes and having a lasting effect for 3-4 hours while the extended-release form onset of action is of 6 hours lasting for about 13 hours.[A176468]","The metabolism of hydromorphone is mainly hepatic and it is represented by the generation of hydromorphone-3-glucuronide through glucuronidation reactions.[A176468] This primary metabolic pathway is done by the activity of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-2B7.[A176501] The first-pass hepatic metabolism is so large that it represents 62% of the initial administered dose.[A176495]

On the other hand, hydromorphone is also characterized by the presence of minor metabolic pathways such as the CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-driven generation of norhydromorphone.[A39478]","The immediate release version of hydromorphone reaches its peak concentration after 30-60 minutes while the extended-release version reaches the peak concentration after 9 hours.[A176468] When administered orally, hydromorphone is absorbed mainly in the upper small intestine with a bioavailability of 60% due to intensive first-pass metabolism. In the controlled-release version of hydromorphone, the absorption follows a biphasic pharmacokinetic profile. However, even though there are clear distinctions in the absorption pathway of hydromorphone, the AUC of both versions is reported to be of 34 ng.h/ml which indicates an equivalence.[A176471]

The parenteral administration of hydromorphone, which is the most common pathway, presents an almost immediate absorption as observed by the presence of peak plasma concentration almost immediately. This peak plasma concentration declines rapidly due to fast redistribution into liver, spleen, kidney and skeletal muscle. In the parenteral route, the pharmacokinetic profile is log-linear and dose-dependent and to present a higher bioavailability of 78%.[A176471]

Other administration routes such as rectal, nasal, intraspinal and transdermal present lower bioavailability and changes in their pharmacokinetic profile.[A176471]",The half-life of hydromorphone immediate-release is of 2-3 hour while the extended release can range from 8-15 hours.[A176468],The protein-bound form of hydromorphone corresponds to about 8-19% of the administered dose.[A176468],The main elimination route of hydromorphone is through the urine in the form of the main metabolite hydromorphone-3-glucuronide. The elimination of the parent compound represents 7% of the urine elimination and 1% of the fecal elimination.[A176468],The volume of distribution of hydromorphone is reported to be of 4 L/kg.[A176468],The mean plasma clearance of hydromorphone is reported to be of 105.7 ml/min.[A176510] The systemic clearance is reported to be of 1.96 L/min.[L5798],,0,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00327.pdf?1553904916,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00327.pdf?1553904249,1,1626,"The reported LD50 of hydromorphone in the mouse was of 104 mg/kg when given intravenously and 84 mg/kg when given orally.[F4181] The reports of overdose with hydromorphone are characterized by respiratory depression, somnolence, skeletal muscle flaccidity,  cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, myosis, mydriasis, bradycardia, hypotension, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and even death.[FDA label]

The management of an overdose might require assisted ventilation, supportive measures, as well as cardiac massage and defibrillation. It can be recommended the use of [naloxone] solely in the cases of respiratory depression. The use of opioid antagonist should be restricted to patients that present respiratory depression as they can produce acute abstinence symptoms.[FDA label]

Hydromorphone was not shown to be mutagenic nor clastogenic and long-term studies of carcinogenicity studies have not been performed. On the other hand, reduced implantation sites and viable fetuses were noted at a 2X normal concentration.[FDA label]"
DB00333,APRD00485,small molecule,2005-06-13,2020-01-02,Methadone,"Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. As a full MOR agonist, methadone mimics the natural effects of the body's opioids, endorphins, and enkephalins through the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission. It also has a number of unique characteristics that have led to its increased use in the last two decades; in particular, methadone has a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to other opioids (due to a lack of active metabolites), minimal accumulation in renal failure, good bioavailability, low cost, and a long duration of action.[F4685,F4688,F4691,A185885,A185900,A185903] 

Due to its unique mechanism of action, methadone is particularly useful for the management of hard to treat pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain and cancer pain requiring higher and more frequent doses of shorter-acting opioids.[A185888,A185891,A185897] Compared with [morphine], the gold standard reference opioid, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors, as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake.[A497,A5344] Specifically by inhibiting the NMDA receptor, methadone dampens a major excitatory pain pathway within the central nervous system.[A185876] Compared to other opioids, methadone's effects on NMDA inhibition may explain it's improved analgesic efficacy and reduced opioid tolerance.[A185891,A185894]

Methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [oxycodone], and [fentanyl]. However, it also has a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Compared with short-acting and even extended-release formulations of [morphine], methadone displays a comparatively longer duration of action and half-life. These effects make methadone a good option for the treatment of severe pain and addiction as fewer doses are needed to maintain analgesia and prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms. However, methadone also has an unpredictable half-life with interindividual variability, which leads to an unpredictable risk of respiratory depression and overdose when initiating or titrating therapy.[A183995]

Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis, sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. At higher doses, methadone use can result in respiratory depression, overdose, and death.[F4685,F4688,F4691]

Treatment of opioid addiction with methadone, [buprenorphine], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptoms for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to lead to social stabilization by reducing crime rates, incarceration, use of illicit opioids such as [heroin] or [fentanyl], and ultimately marginalization.[A185882] Illegally purchased opioids present many other harms in addition to overdose as they can be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use such as contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.",76-99-3,UC6VBE7V1Z,309.4452,309.209264491,solid,1,20,0,0,"Charles J. Barnett, ""Modification of methadone synthesis process step."" U.S. Patent US4048211, issued August, 1952.","Methadone is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. It's recommended that use is reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (eg, nonopioid analgesics, opioid combination products) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.[F4688]

Methadone is also indicated for detoxification treatment of opioid addiction (heroin or other morphine-like drugs), and for maintenance substitution treatment for opioid dependence in adults in conjunction with appropriate social and medical services.[F4685,F4691]","Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis (through binding to receptors in the pupillary muscles), sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. Like many basic drugs, methadone also enters mast cells and releases histamine by a non-immunological mechanism leading to flushing, pruritus, and urticaria, which can commonly be misattributed to an allergic reaction. 

Compared to other opioids, methadone has fewer active metabolites and therefore a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity. This means that higher doses needed to manage severe pain or addiction are less likely to result in delirium, hyperalgesia, or seizures.[A185900,A185903]

Similar to morphine, both methadone isomers are 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, although l-methadone produces greater inhibition than d-methadone. 

Methadone's effects are reversible by naloxone with a pA2 value similar to its antagonism of morphine.[F4685,F4688,F4691]


**Dependence and Tolerance**

As with other opioids, tolerance and physical dependence may develop upon repeated administration of methadone and there is a potential for development of psychological dependence. Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse.

Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4685,F4688,F4691]


**Cardiac Conduction Effects**

Laboratory studies, both in vivo and in vitro, have demonstrated that methadone inhibits cardiac potassium channels and prolongs the QT interval. Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Methadone should be administered with particular caution to patients already at risk for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). Careful monitoring is recommended when using methadone in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disease, those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction, and in other cases where history or physical exam suggest an increased risk of dysrhythmia.[F4685,F4688,F4691]


**Respiratory Depression and Overdose**

Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of methadone. Patients should be
monitored for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of methadone or following a dose increase.

Respiratory depression is of particular concern in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Methadone should be administered with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, and CNS depression or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of methadone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Alternative, non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and methadone should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose.

Infants exposed in-utero or through breast milk are at risk of life-threatening respiratory depression upon delivery or when nursed. 

Methadone's peak respiratory depressant effects typically occur later, and persist longer than its peak analgesic effects, in the short-term use setting. These characteristics can contribute to cases of iatrogenic overdose, particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration.[F4685,F4688,F4691]


**Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure**

The respiratory depressant effects of opioids and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce effects which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. In such patients, methadone must be used with caution, and only if it is deemed essential.[F4685,F4688,F4691]


**Incomplete Cross-tolerance between Methadone and other Opioids**

Patients tolerant to other opioids may be incompletely tolerant to methadone. Incomplete cross-tolerance is of particular concern for patients tolerant to other µ-opioid agonists who are being converted to methadone, thus making the determination of dosing during opioid conversion complex. Deaths have been reported during conversion from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists. A high degree of “opioid tolerance” does not eliminate the possibility of methadone overdose, iatrogenic or otherwise.[F4685,F4688,F4691]

Crosstolerance between morphine and methadone has been demonstrated, as steady-state plasma methadone concentrations required for effectiveness (C50%) were higher in abstinent rats previously dosed with morphine, as compared to controls.


**Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids**

Methadone is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Methadone, like morphine and other opioids used for analgesia, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion.

Methadone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when dispensing Methadone in situations where the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.[F4685,F4688,F4691]


**Hypotensive Effect**

The administration of methadone may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain normal blood pressure is compromised (e.g., severe volume depletion).[F4685,F4688,F4691]


**Gastrointestinal Effects**

Methadone and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation. This primarily occurs through agonism of opioid receptors in the gut wall. Methadone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.[F4685,F4688,F4691]


**Sexual Function/Reproduction**

Reproductive function in human males may be decreased by methadone treatment. Reductions in ejaculate volume and seminal vesicle and prostate secretions have been reported in methadone-treated individuals. In addition, reductions in serum testosterone levels and sperm motility, and abnormalities in sperm morphology have been reported. Long-term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as low libido, erectile dysfunction, or infertility.[F4685,F4688,F4691]","Methadone is a synthetic opioid analgesic with full agonist activity at the µ-opioid receptor. While agonism of the µ-opioid receptor is the primary mechanism of action for the treatment of pain, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous systems. Interestingly, methadone differs from [morphine] (which is considered the gold standard reference opioid) in its antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and its strong inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake, which likely also contributes to its antinociceptive activity.[A497] 

Methadone is administered as a 50:50 racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers, with (R)-methadone demonstrating ~10-fold higher affinity and potency for the µ-opioid receptor than the (S) stereoisomer.[A497] The analgesic activity of the racemate is almost entirely due to the (R)-isomer, while the (S)-isomer lacks significant respiratory depressant activity but does have antitussive effects.

While methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [oxycodone], and [fentanyl] it has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that distinguish it from them and make it a useful agent for the treatment of opioid addiction. For example, methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe.","Methadone undergoes fairly extensive first-pass metabolism. Cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6, are responsible for conversion of methadone to EDDP (2-ethyl-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine) and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted mainly in the urine. Methadone first undergoes N-demethylation to form a highly unstable compound that spontaneously converts to EDDP through cyclization and dehydration. EDDP is then converted to 2-ethyl5-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-1-pyrroline (EDMP). Both EDDP and EDMP are inactive.[F4685,F4691,A185234]

The CYP isozymes also demonstrate different affinities for metabolizing the different methadone enantiomers: CYP2C19, CYP3A7, and CYP2C8 preferentially metabolize (R)-methadone while CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP2C18 preferentially metabolize (S)-methadone. CYP3A4 does not have an enantiomer preference.[A184061,A185234]

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the cytochrome P450 enzymes can impact methadone pharmacokinetics and contribute to the interindividual variation in response to methadone therapy. In particular, CYP2B6 polymorphisms have been shown to impact individual response to methadone as it is the predominant determinant involved in the N-demethylation of methadone, clearance, and the metabolic ratios of [methadone\]/[EDDP].[A184610] The SNPs CYP2B6\*6, \*9, \*11, CYP2C19\*2, \*3, CYP3A4\*1B, and CYP3A5\*3 result in increased methadone plasma concentrations, decreased N-demethylation, and decreased methadone clearance, while homozygous carriers of CYP2B6\*6/\*6 demonstrate diminished metabolism and clearance of methadone.[A184610] See the pharmacogenomics section for further information.

Pharmacogenomic effects on the CYP enzymes can be significant as the long half-life of methadone can result in some individuals having higher than normal therapeutic levels which puts them at risk of dose-related side effects. For example, elevated (R)-methadone levels can increase the risk of respiratory depression, while elevated (S)-methadone levels can increase the risk of severe cardiac arrhythmias due to prolonged QTc interval.[A184610]","Methadone is one of the more lipid-soluble opioids and is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Following oral administration of methadone, bioavailability ranges from 36-100%, with a marked interindividual variation. It can be detected in blood as soon as 15-45 minutes following administration with peak plasma concentrations achieved between 1 to 7.5 hours. A second peak is observed ~4 hours after administration and is likely due to enterohepatic circulation.  Dose proportionality of methadone pharmacokinetics is not known.[A497,F4685,F4688,F4691]

Following administration of daily oral doses ranging from 10 to 225 mg the steady-state plasma concentrations ranged between 65 to 630 ng/mL and the peak concentrations ranged between 124 to 1255 ng/mL. Effect of food on the bioavailability of methadone has not been evaluated.[A497,F4685,F4688,F4691]

Slower absorption is observed in opioid users compared to healthy subjects, which may reflect the pharmacological effect of opioids in slowing gastric emptying and mobility.[A497,F4685,F4688,F4691]

Due to the large inter-individual variation in methadone pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, treatment should be individualized to each patient. There was an up to 17-fold interindividual variation found in methadone blood concentrations for a given dosage, likely due in part to individual variability in CYP enzyme function.[A497] There is also a large variability in pharmacokinetics between methadone's enantiomers, which further complicates pharmacokinetic interpretation and study.[A183995]","Due to interindividual differences in pharmacokinetics, estimates of methadone's half-life have ranged from 15–207 hours[A183995] with official monographs listing it between 7-59 hours.[F4685,F4688,F4691]","Methadone is highly bound to plasma proteins. While it primarily binds to α1-acid glycoprotein (85-90%), it also binds to albumin and other tissue and plasma proteins including lipoproteins. Methadone is unusual in the opioid class, in that there is extensive binding to tissue proteins and fairly slow transfer between some parts of this tissue reservoir and the plasma.[A497,F4691,A185234]","The elimination of methadone is mediated by extensive biotransformation, followed by renal and fecal excretion. Unmetabolized methadone and its metabolites are excreted in urine to a variable degree.","Due to interindividual differences in pharmacokinetics, estimates of methadone's volume of distribution have ranged from 189-470 L[A183995] with monographs listing it between 1.0-8.0L/kg.[F4685,F4688,F4691] As this is higher than physiological volumes of total body water, methadone is highly distributed in the body including brain, gut, kidney, liver, muscle, and lung. A population pharmacokinetic study found that subject gender and weight explained ~33% of the variance in the apparent volume of distribution of methadone.[A497,F4691]

Methadone is found to be secreted in saliva, sweat, breast milk, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord plasma. The concentration in cord blood is about half the maternal levels.[F4691]","Due to interindividual differences in pharmacokinetics, estimates of methadone's clearance have ranged from 5.9–13 L/h hours[A183995] with approved monographs listing it between 1.4 to 126 L/h.[F4685,F4688,F4691]",AdolanDepridolHeptadonHeptanonKetalginMephenonPhyseptone,0,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00333.pdf?1265922805,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00333.pdf?1265922743,1,2152,"In severe overdosage, particularly by the intravenous route, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death may occur."

Meperidine is recommended for relief of moderate to severe acute pain and has the unique ability to interrupt postoperative shivering and shaking chills induced by amphotericin B. Meperidine has also been used for intravenous regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks and intraarticular, epidural and spinal analgesia. Meperidine is considered a second-line agent for the treatment of acute pain.","Meperidine is primarily a kappa-opiate receptor agonist and also has local anesthetic effects. Meperidine has more affinity for the kappa-receptor than morphine. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.","Meperidine is metabolized in the liver by hydrolysis to meperidinic acid followed by partial conjugation with glucuronic acid. Meperidine also undergoes N-demethylation to normeperidine, which then undergoes hydrolysis and partial conjugation. Normeperidine is about half as potent as meperidine, but it has twice the CNS stimulation effects.","The oral bioavailability of meperidine in patients with normal hepatic function is 50-60% due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Bioavailability increases to 80-90% in patients with hepatic impairment (e.g. liver cirrhosis). Meperidine is less than half as effective when administered orally compared to parenteral administration. One study reported that 80-85% of the drug administered intramuscularly was absorbed within 6 hours of intragluteal injection in health adults; however, inter-individual variation and patient-specific variable appear to cause considerable variations in absorption upon IM injection. ",Initial distribution phase (t<sub>1/2 &alpha;</sub>) = 2-11 minutes; terminal elimination phase (t<sub>1/2 &beta;</sub>) =  3-5 hours. In patients with hepatic dysfunction (e.g. liver cirrhosis or active viral hepatitis) the t<sub>1/2 &beta;</sub> is prolonged to 7-11 hours.,"60-80% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin and &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein. The presence of cirrhosis or active viral hepatitis does not appear to affect the extent of protein binding. ","Excreted in the urine. The proportion of drug that is excreted unchanged or as metabolites is dependent on pH. When urine pH is uncontrolled, 5-30% of the meperidine dose is excreted as normeperidine and approximately 5% is excreted unchanged. Meperidine and normeperidine are found in acidic urine, while the free and conjugated forms of meperidinic and normperidinic acids are found in alkaline urine. ",Meperidine crosses the placenta and is distributed into breast milk. ,,Dolantinsanofi-aventisDolcontralmibeDolosalCristáliaDolsinBiotikaLydolSopharmaMialginZentivaPetidinNycomed,0,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00454.pdf?1265922795,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00454.pdf?1265922735,1,2036,

[FDA label]","**Effect on the Central Nervous System (CNS)**

 In clinical settings, sufentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary therapeutic actions are analgesia and sedation. Sufentanil may increase pain tolerance and decrease the perception of pain. This drug depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils [F2009], [A39637]. When used in balanced general anesthesia, sufentanil has been reported to be as much as 10 times as potent as fentanyl. When administered intravenously as a primary anesthetic agent with 100% oxygen, sufentanil is approximately 5 to 7 times as potent as fentanyl [FDA label]. High doses of intravenous sufentanil have been shown to cause muscle rigidity, likely as a result of an effect on the substantia nigra and the striate nucleus in the brain. Sleep-inducing (hypnotic) activity can be demonstrated by EEG alterations [FDA label].

**Effects on the Respiratory System**

Sufentanil may cause respiratory depression [FDA label].

**Effects on the Cardiovascular System**

Sufentanil causes peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Bradycardia may also occur [F2009]. Clinical signs or symptoms of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension [FDA label].

**Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract**

Sufentanil causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in both the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine may be delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased and lead to spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, as well as temporary elevations in serum amylase [FDA label].","Sufentanil is a synthetic, potent opioid with highly selective binding to μ-opioid receptors [F2009]. These receptors are widely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues [A39636], [A39637].

In general, opioids decrease cAMP (affecting neural signaling pathways), decrease neurotransmitter release, and cause membrane hyperpolarization, all of which contribute to the relief of painful symptoms [A39637].

Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic neural transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate receptor leads to the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP, located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. The release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is then inhibited [A39637]. 

Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist), also preventing neurotransmitter release [A39637].

**A Note on Respiratory Depression**

Major, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even in cases where it is used as recommended. Respiratory depression may lead to respiratory arrest and death if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. This drug should be administered only by persons specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids, including respiration and cardiac resuscitation of patients in the age group being treated. This training must include the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation [FDA label].

**Carcinogenesis**
Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of sufentanil have not been conducted [FDA label].

**Mutagenesis**
Sufentanil was not found to be genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay) or in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleous assay [FDA label].

**Reproductive Toxicity**

Sufentanil caused embryolethality in rats and rabbits treated for 10-30 days during pregnancy with 2.5 times the maximum human dose by intravenous administration. The embryolethal effect was thought to be secondary to the toxicity for the mother animal model. No negative effects were noted in another study in rats that were treated with 20 times the maximum human dose in the period of organogenesis. The preclinical effects were only seen following administrations of levels significantly above the maximum human dose, which is therefore of minimal relevance for clinical use [F2009].

**The Use in Lactation**

Infants exposed to this drug through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression [FDA label]."

Alfentanil interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, alfentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Alfentanil may increase the patient's tolerance for pain and decrease the perception of suffering, although the presence of the pain itself may still be recognized. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Alfentanil depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils.","Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Alfentanil's analgesic activity is, most likely, due to its conversion to morphine. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist).

Aminolevulinic acid is not a photosensitizer, but rather a metabolic precursor of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), which is a photosensitizer. The synthesis of ALA is normally tightly controlled by feedback inhibition of the enzyme, ALA synthetase, presumably by intracellular heme levels. ALA, when provided to the cell, bypasses this control point and results in the accumulation of PpIX, which is converted into heme by ferrochelatase through the addition of iron to the PpIX nucleus.","According to the presumed mechanism of action, photosensitization following application of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) topical solution occurs through the metabolic conversion of ALA to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), which accumulates in the skin to which aminolevulinic acid has been applied. When exposed to light of appropriate wavelength and energy, the accumulated PpIX produces a photodynamic reaction, a cytotoxic process dependent upon the simultaneous presence of light and oxygen. The absorption of light results in an excited state of the porphyrin molecule, and subsequent spin transfer from PpIX to molecular oxygen generates singlet oxygen, which can further react to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals.

Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids such as anileridine close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist).

DB00921,APRD00670,small molecule,2005-06-13,2020-01-02,Buprenorphine,"Buprenorphine is a weak partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and a weak kappa-opioid receptor antagonist used for the treatment of severe pain.[A186283,A186292] It is also commonly used as an alternative to [methadone] for the treatment of severe opioid addiction.[F4715,F4718] Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with [naloxone], a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.[A186289,F4715,F4718] Buprenorphine has poor gastrointestinal absorption and is therefore formulated as a sublingual tablet.

Buprenorphine has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that make it a preferred agent for the treatment of conditions requiring high doses of strong opioids.[A186286] For example, buprenorphine dissociates from opioid receptors very slowly, resulting in a long duration of action and relief from pain or withdrawal symptoms for upwards of 24-36 hours. Use of once-daily buprenorphine may benefit individuals who have developed tolerance to other potent opioids and who require larger and more frequent doses. Buprenorphine may also be a preferred agent over [methadone] (which is also commonly used to treat severe pain and opioid use disorder), as it has less effect on Qtc interval prolongation,[A186271,A186274] fewer drug interactions, reduced risk of sexual side effects,[A186298] and an improved safety profile with a lower risk of overdose and respiratory depression.[A186263,A186266,A186269]

Buprenorphine acts as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with a high affinity for the receptor, but lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as [heroin], [oxycodone], or [methadone].[A186292] This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the ""ceiling effect"" where once a certain dose is reached, buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218] It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.[A186280]

Treatment of opioid addiction with buprenorphine, [methadone], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptomns for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to improved social stabilization including a reduction in crime rates, marginalization, incarceration, and use of illicit substances such as [heroin] or [fentanyl]. Illegally purchased opioids can often be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use which includes contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.[A186295]",52485-79-7,40D3SCR4GZ,467.6401,467.303558805,solid,4,18,0,0,"Kazuhisa Ninomiya, Yasuhiro Fukushima, Mutsuo Okumura, Yuko Hosokawa, ""Buprenorphine percutaneous absorption preparation."" U.S. Patent US6090405, issued August, 1992.","Buprenorphine is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Buprenorphine is also used in combination with [naloxone] in a fixed-dose combination product for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder.[F4715,F4718]","Buprenorphine interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, buprenorphine exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Buprenorphine depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils. 


**Dependence**

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.[F4718]


**Withdrawal**

Abrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in an opioid withdrawal syndrome that may be delayed in onset. Signs and symptoms may include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4718]


**Risk of Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression and Overdose**

Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressant, including alcohol. Use buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression).[F4715,F4718]


**Risk of Overdose in Opioid Naïve Patients**

There have been reported deaths of opioid-naïve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic in opioid-naïve patients.[F4715,F4718]


**Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms**

If buprenorphine is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids and cause a phenomenon known as ""precipitated withdrawal"" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms. Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine. 

Because it contains naloxone, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are also highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone.[F4715,F4718]


**Gastrointestinal Effects**

Buprenorphine and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation. Buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions and should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.[F4715,F4718]


**Effects on the Endocrine System**

Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation.[F4715,F4718]


**Adrenal Insufficiency**

Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.[F4715,F4718]


**Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function**

Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphine’s efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of (treatment induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. However, patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine’s efficacy.[F4715,F4718]


**Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events**

Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.[F4715,F4718]


**Orthostatic Hypotension**

Like other opioids, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.


**Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure**

Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation.


**Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure**

Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.","Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. It demonstrates a high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor but has lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as [heroin], [oxycodone], or [methadone].[A186292] This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the ""ceiling effect"" where once a certain dose is reached buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218] It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.[A186280]

Buprenorphine's high affinity, but low intrinsic activity for the mu-opioid receptor also means that if it is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids without creating an equal opioid effect and cause a phenomenon known as ""precipitated withdrawal"" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms (i.e. anxiety, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, intense drug cravings, and tachycardia). Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine. 

Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with [naloxone], a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination of an opioid agonist with an opioid antagonist may seem counterintuitive, however this combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.[A186289,F4715,F4718] ","Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine via Cytochrome P450 3A4/3A5-mediated N-dealkylation. Buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine both also undergo glucuronidation to the inactive metabolites buprenorphine-3-glucuronide and norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide, respectively.[A187430,F4715,F4718]

While norbuprenorphine has been found to bind to opioid receptors in-vitro, brain concentrations are very low which suggests that it does not contribute to the clinical effects of buprenorphine.[A187430]

[Naloxone] undergoes direct glucuronidation to naloxone-3-glucuronide as well as N-dealkylation, and reduction of the 6-oxo group.[F4715,F4718]","Bioavailablity of buprenorphine/naloxone is very high following intravenous or subcutaneous administration, lower by the sublingual or buccal route, and very low when administered by the oral route. It is therefore provided as a sublingual tablet that is absorbed from the oral mucosa directly into systemic circulation.[A187430] 

Clinical pharmacokinetic studies found that there was wide inter-patient variability in the sublingual absorption of buprenorphine and naloxone, but within subjects the variability was low. Both Cmax and AUC of buprenorphine increased in a linear fashion with the increase in dose (in the range of 4 to 16 mg), although the increase was not directly dose-proportional. Buprenorphine combination with naloxone (2mg/0.5mg) provided in sublingual tablets demonstrated a Cmax of 0.780 ng/mL with a Tmax of 1.50 hr and AUC of 7.651 ng.hr/mL.[F4715,F4718]

Coadministration with naloxone does not effect the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine.","Buprenorphine demonstrates slow dissociation kinetics (~166 min), which contributes to its long duration of action and allows for once-daily or even every-second-day dosing.[A187430] In clinical trial studies, the half-life of sublingually administered buprenorphine/naloxone 2mg/0.5mg was found to be 30.75 hours.[F4715,F4718]","Buprenorphine is approximately 96% protein-bound, primarily to alpha- and beta-globulin.[F4715,F4718]","Buprenorphine, like morphine and other phenolic opioid analgesics, is metabolized by the liver and its clearance is related to hepatic blood flow. It is primarily eliminated via feces (as free forms of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine) while 10 - 30% of the dose is excreted in urine (as conjugated forms of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine).[F4715,F4718]

The overall mean elimination half-life of buprenorphine in plasma ranges from 31 to 42 hours, although the levels are very low 10 hours after dosing (majority of AUC of buprenorphine is captured within 10 hours), indicating that the effective half-life may be shorter.[F4715,F4718]","Buprenorphine is highly lipophilic, and therefore extensively distributed, with rapid penetration through the blood-brain barrier. The estimated volume of distribution is 188 - 335 L when given intravenously. It is able to cross into the placenta and breast milk. ","Clearance may be higher in children than in adults. 
Plasma clearance rate, IV administration, anaesthetized patients = 901.2 ± 39.7 mL/min;
Plasma clearance rate, IV administration, healthy subjects = 1042 - 1280 mL/min.

Historically, hydrocodone has been used as a cough suppressant although this has largely been replaced by [dextromethorphan] in current cough and cold formulations. Hydrocodone's more potent metabolite, [hydromorphone] has also found wide use as an analgesic and is frequently used in cases of severe pain.

Its actions in the brain also produce euphoria, respiratory depression, and sedation.","Hydrocodone binds to the mu opioid receptor (MOR) with the highest affinity followed by the delta opioid receptors (DOR).[A182165] Hydrocodone's agonist effect at the MOR is considered to contribute the most to its analgesic effects. Both MOR and DOR are Gi/o coupled and and produces its signal through activation of inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels, inhibition of voltage gated calcium channel opening, and decreased adenylyl cyclase activity.[T116] In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, activation of pre-synaptic MOR on primary afferents the inhibition of calcium channel opening and increased activity of GIRK channels hyperpolarizes the neuron and prevents release of neurotransmitters. Post-synaptic MOR can also prevent activation of neurons by glutamate through the aforementioned mechanisms. 

Hydrocodone can also produce several actions in the brain similarly to other opioids. 
Activation of MOR in the periaquaductal gray (PAG) inhibits the GABAergic tone on medulo-spinal neurons.[T116,A176495] This allows these neurons, which project to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, to suppress pain signalling in secondary afferents by activating inhibitory interneurons. MOR can also inhibit GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, removing the inhibitory tone on dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens and contributing to the activation of the brain's reward and addiction pathway. The inhibitory action or MOR likely contributes to respiratory depression, sedation, and suppression of the cough reflex. 

Activation of DOR may contribute to analgesia through the above mechanisms but has not been well studied.[A176495]","Hydrocodone undergoes oxidative O-demethylation to form [hydromorphone], a more potent active metabolite.[A182114] Though hydromorphone is active it is not present in sufficient quantities to contribute significantly to hydrocodone's therapeutic effects.[A182150] Both hydrocodone and hydromorphone form 6-α- and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites through 6-ketoreduction. The hydroxy metabolites and hydromorphone can form glucuronide conjugates. Hydrocodone also undergoes oxidative N-demthylation to norhydrocodone. O-demethylation is primarily catalyzed by CYP2D6 while N-demethylation is primarily CYP3A4.[A14920]","The absolute bioavailability of hydrocodone has not been characterized due to lack of an IV formulation.

DB01183,APRD00025,small molecule,2005-06-13,2020-01-02,Naloxone,"Naloxone is an opioid antagonist medication used to block or reverse the effects of opioid drugs, particularly within the setting of drug overdoses which are rapidly becoming a leading cause of death worldwide. More specifically, naloxone has a high affinity for μ-opioid receptors, where it acts as an inverse agonist, causing the rapid removal of any other drugs bound to these receptors. When taken in large quantities, opioid medications such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [methadone], [heroin], or [fentanyl] are capable of causing life-threatening symptoms such as respiratory depression, reduced heart rate, slurred speech, drowsiness, and constricted pupils. If untreated, this can progress to vomiting, absent pulse and breathing, loss of consciousness, and even death. Naloxone is indicated for the rapid reversal of these symptoms of central nervous system depression in opioid overdose. It's important to note that naloxone only works on opioid receptors within the body, and is therefore not capable of reversing the effects of non-opioid medications such as stimulants like [methamphetamine] or [cocaine], or benzodiazepines like [lorazepam] or [diazepam]. 

Also known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion. Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of ""kits"", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community. Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key component of harm reduction strategies.

When injected intramuscularly (IM), naloxone acts within 3-5 minutes. Administration of naloxone is associated with very few side effects. Notably, if injected into a person not currently using opioid medications, there would be no noticeable effects at all. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms. Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, aches, and diarrhea. Although certainly physically uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening; administration of naloxone is therefore appropriate for any person appearing to have any symptoms of an opioid overdose. Due to its short duration of action, persons injected with naloxone should be monitored for responsiveness and potentially injected a second time or taken to the hospital.

Naloxone is also available within the combination product Suboxone with the opioid medication [buprenorphine]. Suboxone is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and addiction. When taken orally, naloxone has no pharmacological effect and does not reduce the effectiveness of the opioid effect of buprenorphine.

(Merck Index, 11th ed) Internationally, diamorphine is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. As heroin, it is illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell in the United States and the UK. However, under the name diamorphine, heroin is a legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom.",561-27-3,70D95007SX,369.411,369.157622851,solid,3,4,0,3,,"Diamorphine, as a prescription medication in the United Kingdom, is indicated for use in the treatment of severe pain associated with surgical procedures, myocardial infarction or pain in the terminally ill and for the relief of dyspnoea in acute pulmonary edema [L4999].","The onset of heroin's effects is dependent on the method of administration. Taken orally, heroin is totally metabolized in vivo via extensive first-pass metabolism into morphine before crossing the blood-brain barrier; so the effects are the same as orally administered morphine [L4996, L4999]. Take by injection, diamorphine's acetyl groups facilitate rapid crossing into the brain [L4996, L4999]. Once in the brain, heroin is rapidly metabolized into morphine by removal of the acetyl groups, therefore making it a prodrug for the delivery of morphine [L4996, L4999]. Subsequently, whether eliciting actions peripherally (on smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, liver, or spleen tissue [L4996], for example) or on the central nervous system, it is ultimately the morphine metabolite of heroin that then binds with opioid receptors and produces the narcotic opioid effects commonly associated with the substance [L4996, L4999].","When administered orally, diamorphine experiences extensive first-pass metabolism by way of deacetylation to generate the active metabolites 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine [L4996, L4999]. Alternatively, when given as an injection the acetyl groups present in the diamorphine/diacetylmorphine compound confer the substance lipophilicity that facilitates diamorphine's rapid crossing of the blood-brain-barrier [L4996, L4999]. Once in the brain, diamorphine is metabolised via deacetylation to the active 6-MAM and morphine metabolites as well [L4996, L4999]. Despite diamorphine possessing little to no opioid agonist activity itself, its rapid transit across the blood-brain-barrier elicits a far faster onset of activity in comparison to the extensive first-pass metabolism of oral administration [L4996, L4999]. Regardless, the metabolism of diamorphine to morphine makes heroin a prodrug for the delivery of morphine [L4996, L4999].

Morphine is subsequently a mu-opioid agonist. It acts on endogenous mu-opioid receptors that are spread in discrete packets throughout the brain, spinal cord and gut in almost all mammals [A2476]. Morphine, along with other opioids, are agonists to four endogenous neurotransmitters [A2476]. They are beta-endorphin, dynorphin, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin [A2476]. The body responds to morphine in the brain by reducing (and sometimes stopping) production of the endogenous opioids when morphine is present [A2476]. Endorphins are regularly released in the brain and nerves, attenuating pain. Their other functions are still obscure, but are probably related to the effects produced by morphine besides analgesia (antitussin, anti-diarrheal) [A2476].

Nevertheless, morphine ultimately elicits the majority of its analgesic activity by binding to mu opioid receptors in both the central and peripheral nervous systems [L5005]. The overall effect of morphine is activation of descending inhibitory pathways of the central nervous system as well as inhibition of nociceptive afferent neurons of the peripheral nervous system, which results in an overall reduction of the nociceptive pain transmission [L5005]. ","Once administered into the body, diamorphine undergoes deacetylation via various esterase enzymes to generate active metabolites like 6-monoacetylmorphine and morphine [L4996, L4999]. In particular, when administered orally, diamorphine undergoes extensive first pass metabolism [L4996, L4999].","Bioavailability is less than 35% when orally administered [A173668]. In particular, some studies have determined that the bioavailability of orally administered diamorphine could be as low as 22.9% (16.4-29.4%) on average in opioid-naive subjects [A173683].

Nevertheless, diamorphine administered by any many medically indicated routes of administration leads to a rapid absorption [L4996]. Peak serum levels are achieved five to ten minutes subcutaneously, three to five minutes intranasally and intramuscularly, and less than one minute intravenously [L4996].","In man, administered diamorphine has a half-life of approximately two to three minutes [L4999]. ","Diamorphine does not bind to plasma protein [L4999]. However, considering diamorphine is considered a prodrug for morphine, morphine itself is about 20 to 35% reversibly bound to human plasma proteins [L4999, F2857]. ",The majority of the drug is excreted via the kidney as glucuronides and to a much lesser extent as morphine [L4999]. About 7-10 % is eliminated via the biliary system into the faeces [L4999].,"Data regarding the volume of distribution specific to diamorphine is not readily accessible or available. However, considering diamorphine is considered a prodrug for morphine, the volume of distribution of morphine has been determined to be approximately 1 to 6 L/kg [F2857].","Some studies have determined a relatively high systemic diacetylmorphine clearance of about 8.7 +/- 2.6 L/min, suggesting that the intestine, liver, and blood might all collectively take part in the first pass metabolism of diacetylmorphine to morphine [A173683], although such clearance observations were made only in opioid-addicted individuals [A173695].

It is the first non-opioid medication for the symptomatic management of opioid discontinuation.[L2801]

Opioid withdrawal syndrome is a debilitating manifestation of opioid dependence.[A33085] This condition is extremely unpleasant lasting several days with some of the main features being abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, mydriasis, lacrimation, and piloerection. These symptoms are often observed after abrupt reductions in the opioid dose and can be resolved by re-administration of the opioid.[A33088]","In clinical trials, lofexidine presented more severe opioid withdrawal effects than observed with methadone. On the other hand, in clinical trials of methadone withdrawal, lofexidine effectively reduced withdrawal symptoms, especially hypotension.[T209] The clinical reports have also indicated that lofexidine presents a better outcome when used briefly.[T210] In phase 3 clinical trials, lofexidine was shown to generate a significantly higher completion rate of opioid discontinuation. Some pharmacological studies were performed and there were no off-target effects reported.[L2801]","Lofexidine is a potent alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist with some moderate agonistic affinity towards Alpha-1A adrenergic receptor and 5-HT1a, 5-HT7, 5HT2c and 5HT1d receptors.[L2801]

The alpha2-adrenergic receptor is normally targeted by norepinephrine and its activation inhibits the synthesis of cAMP which in turn leads to potassium efflux and suppression of neural firing and inhibition of norepinephrine release. All of this activity can reduce the heart rate, blood pressure, and attenuate sympathetic stress response.[L2801]

Opioids inhibit cAMP in the noradrenergic neurons and their discontinuation produces a rise in the level of cAMP. This will generate an increase in norepinephrine which is associated with the symptoms of withdrawal. The magnitude of the effect is augmented by chronic opioid use due to the compensatory mechanisms of continuous negative feedback. Therefore, chronic opioid use translates into an exacerbated production of cAMP and norepinephrine release.[L2801]

Lofexidine replaces the opioid-driven inhibition of cAMP production by activating the alpha2-adrenergic receptor and moderating the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. This effect is performed without interacting with opioid receptors which mediate other activities of opioid dependence or addiction.[L2801]","Lofexidine metabolic ratio is highly variable among people.[T210] It is metabolized mainly by the activity of CYP2D6 and in a minor degree by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. These enzymes catalyze the hydroxylation of lofexidine and the opening of imidazoline ring to form N-(2-aminoethyl)-2-(2,6-dichlorophenoxy)propanamide. This metabolite is deamidated and forms 2-(2,6-dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid and 2,6-dichlorophenol. These three main metabolites are inactive.[L2801]","Lofexidine has a good oral bioavailability and the peak plasma concentration occurs after 2-5 hours of oral administration.[T210] The bioavailability is registered to be even higher than 72%.[T55] About 30% of the administered dose of lofexidine is lost during first-pass metabolism. The absorption is registered to be very rapidly recirculated in the gut. After oral administration of 0.8 mg of lofexidine, a maximal dose of 1.26 ng/ml is achieved after 3 hours.[L2801]",The reported elimination half-life of lofexidine is 11 hours.[T55],The protein binding of lofexidine is determined to be moderate and it represents about 55% of the administered dose.[L2801],"The elimination of lofexidine is primarily through the renal system and it represents 94% of the administered dose while  elimination in feces corresponds to only 0.93%.[T210] From the eliminated dose in urine, about 10% is formed by unchanged drug and 5% is constituted by the first hydrolysis product N-(2-aminoethyl)-2-(2,6-dichlorophenoxy)propanamide. 2,6-dichlorophenol represents the majority of the administered dose by occupying about 80% of the administered dose.[L2801]","Lofexidine has a volume of distribution of 300 L, indicating that it distributes readily into the tissues.[L2801]",The total elimination clearance following intravenous administration is 17.6 L/h.[L2801],BritlofexBritannia,0,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB04948.pdf?1526591898,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB04948.pdf?1526595617,0,2016,"Lofexidine did not exhibit genotoxic, mutagenic nor mutagenic potential.

DB06230,,small molecule,2008-03-19,2020-01-02,Nalmefene,"Nalmefene is a 6-methylene analogue of naltrexone and opioid system modulator but with no opioid activity [FDA Label]. It mediates a partial agonist effect on kappa receptors [A31301]. It is primarily used in the management of alcohol dependence in adult patients in conjunction with continuous psychosocial support focused on treatment adherence and reducing alcohol consumption [L1024] when it is exists as the hydrochloride dihydrate form under the trade name Selincro. Selincro is orally administered as tablets. Nalmefene works to reduce alcohol consumption in individuals by positive reward effect of alcohol which involves the opioid system, as well as the sedative and dysphoric properties of alcohol [A31301]. 

It is also indicated to prevent or reverse the effects of opioids, including respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension by acting on the opioid receptor as an antagonist [FDA Label] under the trade name Revex for intramuscular, intravenous and subcutaneous injection, where nalmefene hydrochloride is an active ingredient.",55096-26-9,TOV02TDP9I,339.435,339.183443669,solid,3,3,0,1,,"Indicated for the reduction of alcohol consumption in adult patients with alcohol dependence who have a high drinking risk level (DRL), without physical withdrawal symptoms and who do not require immediate detoxification [L1024].

Indicated for the complete or partial reversal of opioid drug effects, including respiratory depression - induced by either natural or synthetic opioids - or in the management of known or suspected opioid overdose [FDA Label].","Nalmefene has not been shown to produce tolerance, physical dependence, or abuse potential [L1024, FDA Label]. 

When adminsitered as an antidote for opioid overdose, nalmefene is not known to produce any respiratory depression, psychomimetic effects, or pupillary constriction [FDA Label]. In the absence of opioid agonists, there was no observable pharmacological activity. Nalmefene injection can produce acute withdrawal symptoms in individuals who are opioid-dependent.","Nalmefene is an opioid system modulator with a distinct μ, δ, and κ receptor profile. It acts as a selective opioid receptor ligand with antagonist activity at the μ and δ receptors and partial agonist activity at the κ receptor [L1024, A31301]. Animal studies suggest that the kappa receptor signalling responses lead to antagonism of acute reward and positive reinforcement effects of drugs by decreasing dopamine in the nucleus accumbens [A31301]. Thus it is suggested that nalmefene may be more effective treatment for alcohol dependence than [DB00704], which is a pure mu and delta receptor antagonist [A31301]. In vivo studies and rat studies have demonstrated that nalmefene reduces self-administration of alcohol, possibly by modulating cortico-mesolimbic functions [L1024]. 

Nalmefene, a 6-methylene analogue of naltrexone, is a competitive opioid antagonist which binds with high affinity to the mu opioid receptor. Nalmefene itself does not induce any opioid activity, but prevents or reverses the effects of opioids such as respiratory depression and sedation when injected[FDA Label]. Some pharmacodynamic studies showed that nalmefene has a longer duration of action than naloxone at fully reversing doses [FDA Label] however the relative potency of these two antagonists are reported to be similar [A31302]. ","Following oral administration, nalmefene undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism where it is metabolized to the major inactive metabolite nalmefene 3-O-glucuronide via glucuronide conjugation. The major enzyme contributing to this reaction is UGT2B7, while UGT1A3 and UGT1A8 also play a minor role. A small proportion of nalmefene is also converted to nalmefene 3-O-sulfate by sulfation, which has a potency comparable to that of nalmefene. However nalmafene 3-O-sulfate is present in concentration less than 10% of that of nalmefene and is less likely to be a major contributor to the pharmacological action of the parent drug. Nalmefene may also be converted to nornalmefene via dealkylation by CYP3A4 or CYP3A5, which is further converted to nornalmefene 3-O-glucuronide and nornalmefene 3-O-sulfate with minimal pharmacological actions [L1024]. ","Following a single oral administration of 18.06 mg, nalmefene is rapidly absorbed with a peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 16.5 ng/ml with the time to reach the peak concentration (Tmax) of approxmately 1.5 hours and the exposure (AUC) of 131 ng x h/ml. Although there is little association to clinical relevance, the AUC and Cmax values are expected to increase by 30 to 50%, respectively, and the Tmax is delayed by 30 minutes after consumption of high-fat food. The absolute oral bioavailability of nalmefene is 41% [L1024]. 

Nalmefene exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics following intravenous injection. The Tmax following intramuscular or subcutaneous injection is approximately 1.5-2.3 hours. In an emergency setting, however, therapeutic plasma concentrations are likely to be reached within 5-15 minutes after a 1 mg dose given intravenously where the plasma concentration is approximately 3.7 ng/mL at 5 minutes in young adult males [FDA Label]. ","The terminal half-life is approximately 12.5 hours following oral administration [L1024]. After intravenous administration of 1 mg in adult males, the terminal half life was 10.8 ± 5.2 hours [FDA Label]. ","The average protein-bound fraction of nalmefene in plasma is approximately 30-45% [L1024, FDA Label]. ",Renal excretion is the main route of elimination for nalmefene and its metabolites. 54% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as nalmefene 3-O-glucuronide. Less than 3% of the dose is excreted as nalmefene or other metabolites [L1024]. Approximatly 17% of the total dose is reported to be excreted in the feces [FDA Label]. ,"The volume of distribution (Vd/F) of oral nalmefene is estimated to be approximately 3200 L [L1024]. According to a PET study after single and repeated daily dosing with 18.06 mg
nalmefene, the drug displayed 94% to 100% receptor occupancy within 3 hours after dosing, indicating that nalmefene readily crosses the blood-brain barrier [L1024]. 

Nalmefene is reported to be rapidly distributed following a 1mg parenteral dose. Parenteral nalmefene also crosses the blood-brain barrier effectively, where the study of brain receptor occupancy demonstrated the blockage of over 80% of brain opioid receptors within 5 minutes after administration. The apparent volumes of distribution centrally (Vc) and at steady-state (Vdss) are 3.9 ± 1.1 L/kg and 8.6 ± 1.7 L/kg, respectively.

DB11130,,small molecule,2015-12-03,2020-01-02,Opium,"Opium is the first substance of the diverse group of the opiates. It has been known for a long time, and the first evidence of a poppy culture dates from 5 thousand years by the Sumerians. During the years, opium was used as a sedative and hypnotic, but it was determined to be addictive.[A32171] 

Opium is extracted from _Papaver somniferum_, which is more known as poppies. This plant is an integrant of the Papaveraceae family, and it is characterized by solitary leaves and capsulated fruits. Therefore, opium is a sticky brown resin obtained by collecting and drying the latex that exudes from the poppy pods.[L1761]

Once extracted, opium contains two main groups of alkaloids; the psychoactive constituents which are in the category of phenanthrenes and alkaloids that have no central nervous system effect in the category of isoquinolines. Morphine is the most prevalent and principal alkaloid in opium, and it is responsible for most of the harmful effects of opium.[L1762]

Opium has gradually been superseded by a variety of synthetic opioids and general anesthetics. Some of the isolated derivatives of opium are morphine, noscapine, strychnine, veratrine, colchicine, codeine, and quinine.[A32175] Opium is a prohibited drug of abuse in most countries, but the illegal production of this drug and its derivatives keeps being registered. There is some legal production of opium in different countries for the obtention of alkaloids by extraction.[L1766]",8008-60-4,37M3MZ001L,,,liquid,2,8,4,6,,"Opium and its derivatives are the most commonly used medications for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Opium and its alkaloid-derivatives can also be used as tranquilizers, antitussives and in the treatment of diarrhea.[T138] The direct use of opium is not common nowadays but the use of some of its derivatives such as morphine and codeine, as well as the use of a tincture of opium for severe diarrhea can be seen in medical practice.[T139]

Illegal use of opium has been registered to be for both recreational and medicinal purposes.[A32182]","Opioids can reduce the intensity and unpleasant feeling of pain. The unspecific effect of opium to the different opioid receptors produce the generation of various effects such as sedation, euphoria, dysphoria, respiratory depression, constipation, pruritus, nausea, and vomiting. It is reported that the secondary effects tend to be diminished as long-term use tolerance is developed. Some reports have also shown an opioid-driven impairment of the hypothalamic function that can result in a loss of libido, impotence, and infertility. Patients have reported a sensation of stress relief even in presence of pain as well as the presence of sedation, hypoventilation, cough inhibition, prolonged apnea, myosis and respiratory obstruction.[T136]

In the cardiovascular system, there are reports of peripheral vasodilatation, including cutaneous causing flushing of the face, neck, and thorax, impaired sympathetic reflexes and postural hypotension. In the gastrointestinal and urogenital system, the increase in smooth muscle tone has been shown to produce reduced peristalsis, delayed gastric emptying and urinary retention.[T136]","Opium produces its effects by activating specific G protein-coupled receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system. There are three major classes of opioid receptors being δ-opioid, κ-opioid and μ-opioid. Opium will generate an agonist activity which will later open the potassium channels and prevent the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels. This activity causes a reduction in neuronal excitability and inhibits the release of pain neurotransmitters.[T136]

The addictive character of opium is related to the binding to the μ-opioid receptors, which will activate dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain and thus, enhance the dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. This mechanism involves the reward activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway.[T137]","Opium contains 50 different alkaloid opiates. The most common metabolism of opiates is to be ultimately converted to morphine which is further converted to morphine-3,6-diglucuronide.[L1780] Opioids are metabolized vastly by the enzyme CYP 2D6 and any mutation in this kind of enzyme or coadministration with drugs that interfere with this enzyme may generate a change in the metabolism speed.[L1807] For years, because of this metabolism pathway, it was very hard to differentiate between illicit heroin users and involuntary exposure to poppy seeds. The original tests for this differentiations were based in the presence of morphine in urine without evidence of 6-monoacetylmorphine. Now it is known the presence of a glucuronide metabolite only in the consumption of heroin called ATM4G and this allows a clear differentiation of the consumption of illegal heroin and poppy seed ingestion.[A32197]","After oral administration, opium bioavailability is poor.[T136] In the form of opioid tincture, the Cmax and AUC of opium are between 16-24 mg/ml and 3237-6727 ng/ml.h, respectively.[A32183]",The half-life of opium ranges between 3-10 hours.[T136],"The protein binding of the alkaloids that form opium, such as morphine and codeine, can range from 20-60% depending on the specific alkaloid. The highest binding proteins for opium alkaloids are albumin and beta-globulin II.[A32195]","Opium is a mixture of different alkaloids including morphine and codeine. After a single ingestion of opium preparations, codeine and morphine can be found excreted in urine. The presence of codeine and morphine in urine seems to be detectable 2-12 hours and 2-36 hours post administration, respectively. The urinary excretion of morphine and codeine seems to be longer as the dose of opium is increased. After multiple dosages of opium, the presence of codeine and morphine in urine could be detected even after 48 and 84 hours post administration, respectively.[A32198] After ingestion of poppy seeds, it is possible to collect morphine and codeine in urine 3-25 hours and 3-22 hours after administration, respectively.[A32199]",Opium presents a large volume of distribution that exceeds the total body water.[T136],,,0,,//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB11130.pdf?1521664885,0,1622,"Some toxicity concerns from the consumption of opium are the generation of addiction, physical dependence and tolerance to the effect.
